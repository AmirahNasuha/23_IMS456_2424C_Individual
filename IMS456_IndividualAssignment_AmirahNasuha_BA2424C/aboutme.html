I have developed my part-time job as a digital worker on Freelancer crowdsourcing platform throughout my career. By putting myself in the shoes of the digital worker, I strive to create intuitive and seamless designing logos, business cards, flyers, posters, brochures, t-shirt designs, and many more experiences in graphic design.
